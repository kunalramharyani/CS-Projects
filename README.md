# CS-Projects

This repository contains all of the projects I have completed to learn more about the areas of web development, data analysis, machine learning, scientific computing and ethical hacking.

I learnt the basics of web development from [Angela Yu's Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) and a bit of mobile app development using React Native from [The Net Ninja's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg).

I learnt the basics of ethical hacking from [Heath Adam's Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/practical-ethical-hacking/) 

I learnt about machine learning, data analysis and scientific computing using python from [freeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/) courses of the same name.

I would recommend all of the courses mentioned above to anyone who is interested in these fields.
They helped me understand what I liked doing the most and what I wanted to pursue as a profession.
