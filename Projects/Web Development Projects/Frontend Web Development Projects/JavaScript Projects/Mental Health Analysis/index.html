            Despite being a persistent challenge throughout history, the current era presents a particularly alarming scenario with unprecedented levels of unemployment. Economic shifts accelerated technological advancements, and the profound impacts of global events have caused fluctuations in unemployment rates. Additionally, the global economic landscape has been marred by disruptions, such as the financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, amplifying unemployment woes. These circumstances underscore the urgency for comprehensive strategies that address not only the immediate concerns of those currently unemployed but also the systemic issues contributing to this unparalleled surge in job insecurity.

            The graph below depicts the unemployment trend in the US (Source: US Department of Bureau of Labor Statistics). As seen in the graph, it can be observed that there are two spikes where unemployment rates were higher than in other periods. One of the spikes occurred during the great recession that happened in the late 2000s and the other corresponds to the period of the recent global pandemic.

              Although the unemployment rates have dropped since the global pandemic, unprecedented historical events show that we cannot expect the unemployment rates to drop continuously.
            </strong>
            These sudden surges in unemployment could have adverse impacts on one's mental health. Therefore, it's important to analyze how severely unemployment could affect the mental well-being of people.
          </p>
          <p>
            It has been repeatedly demonstrated that unemployment, defined as not having a job but seeking one, negatively affects a range of health outcomes. There are various ways that unemployment might be detrimental to one's health.

                Through stress and reduced self-esteem resulting from the loss of the routine of work or the stigma associated with unemployment as a result of financial hardship, insecurity, and reduced future earnings potential.

          <p>
            Long-term unemployment has been demonstrated to have negative effects on both physical and mental health as well as life satisfaction. Extended periods of lower income, job loss, or unemployment have resulted from pandemic limitations; the long duration of these situations is especially concerning.
          </p>
          <p>
            The long-term damage that unemployment can do to one's future earning potential is one of the reasons why policymakers are interested in unemployment, especially when it affects young people. Research, however, also indicates that young unemployment—as well as several spells of unemployment during the life course—may have long-term detrimental impacts on mental health.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have structured our article as follows.
            <strong>
              First, we will try to identify the effect of income level and education on unemployment and mental health. Then, we will move our focus to analyze one's status of education and identify how it drives one's mental well-being and employment status. Afterward, we attempt to understand the impact of unemployment on mental health across different age groups.  Finally, we will delve into other socioeconomic factors that may directly/indirectly affect the mental well-being of an individual.

             The below decision tree graph shows the contribution of each factor to one's unemployment status and mental health. In this graph, we first identified groups that fall under the category of having an income greater than the median US income of $25,000 and those that fall below that line. Then we analyzed their educational qualifications, employment status, and ultimately whether unemployment acts as a precursor to one's mental well-being.

                Also, it shows that despite one may not complete their undergraduate degree, they are less likely to suffer mental illness if they are employed. This proves that employment status is a crucial factor for mental health.

              <li>
                Also, it shows that if one has an external source of income despite being unemployed or not completing the undergraduate degree, then they're still less likely to suffer from mental illness. This shows that the economic status of an individual acts as an alarming factor in general.

            Through careful inspection of the various aspects that contribute to mental well-being, it can be seen that those who have completed high school or a degree including and above the level of an undergraduate degree are less likely to suffer from a mental illness or be unemployed.

              Hence, we can conclude that the level of education someone has will have an impact on their mental well-being and employability.

And also, if the category 'above 60' is not considered, since they are senior citizens, the highest unemployment rate is also from this age category '18-29'. In contrast, the age category '45-60' has the highest rate of employment and lowest rate of having a mental illness.

            It is crucial for policy design to do such analysis and comprehend the mental health requirements of various age groups.

          </h2>
          <p>
            Maintaining strong employment levels in the face of trend analysis that shows an increase in unemployment will be vital.
            <strong>
              A substantial percentage of those who are unemployed struggle with mental health issues like depression and anxiety.
            </strong>
            Getting these people back to work will be essential to increasing employment rates and fostering economic growth.
          </p>
          <p>
            The government can provide assistance in several ways. First and foremost, it's critical that measures to remove the financial assistance provided during the pandemic are implemented in a way that doesn't worsen mental illness. Secondly, certain policy adjustments are necessary to assist individuals in finding quality employment subsequently. These could involve helping to provide flexible employment options and customizing employment support services for those with poor mental health.
          </p>
          <p>
            At a deeper level, the government must give mental health far greater priority.
            <strong>
              One of the most valuable resources in the country is a healthy populace, and mental and physical well-being are essential components of our future success since they enhance people's well-being, productivity, and capacity to engage in society.
