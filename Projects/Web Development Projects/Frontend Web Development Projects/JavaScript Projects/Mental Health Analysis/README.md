## Socioeconomic Factors and Their Correlation with Mental Health: A Comprehensive Analysis

\- CMSC734 Team 7 Narrative Visualization ðŸ“°

#### Project Description ðŸ–Š

Maintaining good mental health is essential for our overall well-being. Unfortunately, external factors can have a significant impact on it. Recently, there has been a concerning increase in unemployment rates, which can have far-reaching implications beyond financial instability. Losing a job can cause stress, financial strain, and disconnection from one's purpose. The connection between unemployment and mental health raises important questions:

- How does joblessness affect our mental state?
  Is the impact solely due to financial strain, or are there deeper, more intricate factors at play?
- Does having greater financial resources or a higher income shield against these mental health challenges?
- Beyond employment, it is crucial to explore other factors that contribute to mental health conditions.

We aim to raise awareness and help communities take preventive measures by addressing these factors and implementing timely interventions.
